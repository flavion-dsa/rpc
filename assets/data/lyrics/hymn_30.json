  "lyrics": "There still be showers of blessing; this is the promise of love.<br>There shall be seasons refreshing, sent from the Saviour above.<br><br>Showers of blessing, showers of blessing we need.<br>Mercy drops round us are falling,<br>But for the showers we plead.<br><br>There shall be showers of blessing; o that today they might fall;<br>Now, as to god weâ€™re confessing; now, as on Jesus we call."
