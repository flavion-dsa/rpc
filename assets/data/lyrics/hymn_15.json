  "lyrics": "How lovely is your dwelling place, O Lord,<br>What peace and joy to feel so close to you!<br>Our heart and soul ring out their joy this morning,<br>We long to meet you, God, the living God.<br><br>The sparrow even here has found a shelter,<br>The swallow by your altars builds a nest;<br>O happy those whose dwelling is your temple,<br>Who day by day your praises sing, O Lord."
