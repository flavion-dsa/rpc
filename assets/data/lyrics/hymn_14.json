  "lyrics": "How good it is to dwell in the brethren of the lord<br>And to share His life today<br>Our hearts all glow and swell when we meet with one accord<br>To worship and to pray.<br><br>You said “Where two or three are gathered in My name<br>There I will always be”.<br>And in your memory we gather to acclaim your promise for eternity.<br><br>How good it is to share in the wisdom of the Lord<br>And to walk His holy way.<br>Gathered here in prayer, where truth is told and heard, we are learning to obey."
