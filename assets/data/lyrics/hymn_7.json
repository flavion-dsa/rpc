  "lyrics": "Come into the circle of God’s infinite kindness<br>And then you will have reason to jubilate.<br>Listen to the wonders God’s ineffable mercy has wrought<br>For the good of his saints.<br><br>Open up my vision, Lord, that I may see<br>That never-ending torrent of Your love for me.<br><br>Come into the sunshine of God’s tender forgiveness,<br>And then you will be shining throughout your days.<br>Listen to the story of God’s wonderful healing<br>In those who return to His ways.<br><br>Come in to the love (2)<br>Welcome to the love of the Lord, of the Lord."
