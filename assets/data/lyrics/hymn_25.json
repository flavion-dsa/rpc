  "lyrics": "On we go to Jerusalem, the city of our God.<br>Pilgrim people we seek the Lord, the Lord of the house of rock.<br><br>Age on age proclaims His praises, each declares Him Lord of all.<br>Countless millions sing his glory, answering his pilgrim call.<br>Peace He promised to our fathers, in the ancient desert land <br>Peace He offers in abundance to His faithful pilgrim band."
