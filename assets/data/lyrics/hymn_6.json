  "lyrics": "Come in, pilgrim, lay your burden down;<br>We’re all comrades as we travel on the way.<br>We share a common gift: our covenant in Christ,<br>And we’re going to celebrate His love today;<br>We will sing and celebrate his love today.<br><br>When we come to join in prayer,<br>Let us first confess<br>That we’ve looked too much to ourselves and loved each other less.<br><br>Hear the Word proclaimed with pow’r to search the hearts of all;<br>We must make its meaning new as we bring it to birth again."
