  "lyrics": "Just like a child who trusts his father dear<br>And who delights to feel his presence near.<br>Just like a child whose mind has not a doubt<br>And whose heart is never proud.<br><br>Here I come, O Lord,<br>Here I come just like a child. (Repeat)<br><br>Just like a child so weak he cannot stand,<br>But who holds firm and tight his motherâ€™s hand,<br>Just like a child who sings in broad daylight<br>Fearing not the long dark night."
